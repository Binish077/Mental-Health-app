print("Inhale/Exhale") #I'm thinking of the 4-7-8 breathing technique but I'm not sure how to implement it

Solution 1
1. variable 'decision' that keeps track of sec set to 1  
2. Store the values(4,7,8) into a tuple or list
3. if/else or switch to countdown from 4,7,or 8
4. Add 1 to decision 
    -if decision is 3, reset to 1
